# High-Performance Fully Typed API Framework for Django

Your first question might be: why? Well, consider this: **Faster than _FastAPI_, but with Django ORM, Django Admin, and Django packages**. That’s exactly what this project achieves. Django-Bolt is a high-performance API framework for Django, providing Rust-powered API endpoints capable of 188k+ RPS. Similar to Django REST Framework or Django Ninja, it integrates seamlessly with existing Django projects while leveraging Actix Web for HTTP handling, PyO3 to bridge Python async handlers with Rust's async runtime, and msgspec for fast serialization. You can deploy it directly—no gunicorn or uvicorn needed.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation 🎉

```bash
pip install django-bolt
```

**📖 Full Documentation:** [bolt.farhana.li](https://bolt.farhana.li/) or if your prefer [youtube video by BugBytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pukr-fT4MFY)

> ⚠️ **Note:** Django-Bolt is under active development. Some features are not yet finalized.

### Run Your First API

```python
# myproject/api.py
from django_bolt import BoltAPI
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
import msgspec

User = get_user_model()

api = BoltAPI()

class UserSchema(msgspec.Struct):
    id: int
    username: str


@api.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> UserSchema: # 🎉 Response is type validated
    user = await User.objects.aget(id=user_id) # 🤯 Yes and Django orm works without any setup
    return {"id": user.id, "username": user.username} # or you could just return the queryset

```

```python
# myproject/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "django_bolt"
    ...
]
```

```bash
# Start the server in dev mode
python manage.py runbolt --dev
```

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks


> **📁 Resources:** Example project available at [python/example/](python/example/). Run benchmarks with `just save-bench` or see [scripts/benchmark.sh](scripts/benchmark.sh).

### Standard Endpoints

| Endpoint Type                  | Requests/sec     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Root endpoint                  | **~188,100 RPS** |
| JSON parsing/validation (10kb) | **~128,400 RPS** |
| Path + Query parameters        | **~163,200 RPS** |
| HTML response                  | **~164,100 RPS** |
| Redirect response              | **~96,300 RPS**  |
| Form data handling             | **~143,900 RPS** |
| ORM reads (SQLite, 10 records) | **~14,800 RPS**  |

### Streaming Performance (Async)

**Server-Sent Events (SSE) with 10,000 concurrent clients (60 Second load time):**

- **Total Throughput:** 9,489 messages/sec
- **Successful Connections:** 10,000 (100%)
- **Avg Messages per Client:** 57.3 messages
- **Data Transfer:** 14.06 MB across test
- **CPU Usage:** 11.9% average during test (peak: 101.9%)
- **Memory Usage:** 236.1 MB

> **Note:** Async streaming is recommended for high-concurrency scenarios (10k+ concurrent connections). It has no thread limits and can handle sustained load efficiently.

**Why so fast?**

- HTTP Parsing and Response is handled by Actix-rs framework (one of the fastest in the world)
- Request routing uses matchit (zero-copy path matching)
- JSON serialization with msgspec (5-10x faster than stdlib)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments & Inspiration

Django-Bolt stands on the shoulders of giants. We're grateful to the following projects and communities that inspired our design and implementation:

### Core Inspirations

- **[Django REST Framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework)** - Our syntax, ViewSet patterns, and permission system are heavily inspired by DRF's elegant API design. The class-based views and guard system follow DRF's philosophy of making common patterns simple.

- **[FastAPI](https://github.com/tivy520/fastapi)** - We drew extensive inspiration from FastAPI's dependency injection system, parameter extraction patterns, and modern Python type hints usage. The codebase structure and async patterns heavily influenced our implementation.

- **[Litestar](https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar)** - Our OpenAPI plugin system is adapted from Litestar's excellent architecture. Many architectural decisions around middleware, guards, and route handling were inspired by Litestar's design philosophy.

- **[Robyn](https://github.com/sparckles/Robyn)** - Robyn's Rust-Python integration patterns and performance-first approach influenced our decision to use PyO3 and showed us the potential of Rust-powered Python web frameworks.

### Additional Credits

- **[Actix Web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web)** - The Rust HTTP framework that powers our performance
- **[PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)** - For making Rust-Python interop seamless
- **[msgspec](https://github.com/jcrist/msgspec)** - For blazing-fast serialization
- **[matchit](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/matchit)** - For zero-copy routing

Thank you to all the maintainers, contributors, and communities behind these projects. Django-Bolt wouldn't exist without your incredible work.
